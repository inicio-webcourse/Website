            <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
            <p>My name is Mikaela Illanes and I'm a serial entrepreneur, business developer and UX and UI designer depending on what day it is.</p>
            <p>But during these two weeks I will be founder of Inicio, web development coach and mentor.</p>
            <p>You can see here that for each paragraph I start you have a new line starts and you get some space in between but if I use a break <br>my line breaks and the space between the lines is smaller.</p>
            <p>BReak is good to use when your text is supposed to go together</p>
            <h3>My biggest tip when it comes to HTML is that you think of it as a document!</h3>
            <p>You have different headings you have paragraphs where you write your normal text but at times it can get super long and look aweful when you write it all in one line or the text might go together and you use. Thats is when you use <br> and continue writing in a new line ;) </p>

        <section id="projects" class="projects">
            <!--Under projects try to work out image grid and add a video-->
            <h1>My projects</h1>
            <p>On this section I will mostly play around with CSS which we will go trhough during week 2 of this course. 
                <br> For now I'll use it to demonstrate when to change between headings</p>
            <h3>Think new heading = new section, <br>but keep in mind to use the same heading size when strating a new section so it looks nice ;)</h3>
